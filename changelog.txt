==========================
Arduino toolbox for Scilab
==========================

v. 1.7.1 (2020-01-05) / chinluh.tan@bytecode-asia.com
BUGS FIXED
* Fixed 2206 Problem with Servo_Write Block
* Restore MPU6050 block

v. 1.7 (2019-10-17) / chinluh.tan@bytecode-asia.com
BUG FIXED
  * Fixed Scilab 6 compatibility issues
  * Change the serial to Scilab from char to double to solved ascii issues.
  * Fixed port >9 not supported issue
  
  NEW FEATURES
  * Multiple boards support (Set to 2 currently as more board yields slow response)
  * Linux/MacOS(?) Support (Thanks to Nikolay Strelkov link in http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/arduino/issues/1556/) 

v. 1.6.2 (2019-06-04) / sgougeon@free.fr
---------------------
 BUG FIXED
 * ARDUINO_pre_simulate() was still too stiff to detect the version answer from the board


v. 1.6 (2019-05-30) / sgougeon@free.fr
-------------------
 BUGS FIXED
 * toolbox_arduino_v4.ino file shipped in the module was bad. Replaced with the right file.
 * ARDUINO_pre_simulate() was expecting arduino_v3.ino instead of arduino_v4.ino
   and yielded an error "Il faut charger avec le logiciel arduino le sketch
   toolbox_arduino_v3.ino dans la carte Arduino" when actually dealing with the v.4
 * The DESCRIPTION file that was removed from v.1.4 is actually needed to instal
   the module offline. Restored.
 * Demos: Examples for Scilab 6.0 are displayed with wrong ports positions with Scilab 5.5.
   The versions for Arduino 1.1 are restored in the binary for the Scilab 5.5.


v. 1.5 (2018-09-08) / sgougeon@free.fr
-------------------
* toolbox_arduino_v4.ino is now shipped within the toolbox, including the
  MPU6050 bloc and filtering. Thanks to David VIOLEAU.
* etc/arduino-style.xml is partly provided (but it does not work).

BUGS FIXED
* Icons labels are restored and improved.
* All demos are restored.
* In the example9.zcos demo, the PI block refered to an inexisting PIcontrol
  function.
* The arduino.start changed the user working directory. Fixed.
* init_arduino() and ARDUINO_post_simulate() had still some old cells


v. 1.4 (2018-09-07) / sgougeon@free.fr
-------------------
This is mainly a repackaging version.

* The builder can now build for both Scilab 5 and Scilab 6
* HELP PAGES
  - images are now gathered in a dedicated directory
  - .tst source files are now gathered in a dedicated directory
  - _README.tst file added: only XML files must be updated/upgraded/translated
  - See also sections: the short descriptions of items are now displayed
  - Contents sections simplified
* DESCRIPTION FILE removed (no longer needed)
* changelog.txt added (this file)
* bin directory created
* BUGS FIXED:
  - the scicos_scicoslib was missing when loading the Arduino module
  - getArduinoVersion() was not up-to-date. It is no longer necessary to update
    it: It now reads the VERSION file.
  - In macros, some messages were in french.
  
TODO:
  * Extend the module to Linux users (through the serial toolbox based on TCL)
  * Translate help pages in english
  * Translate error blocks interfaces and messages
  * Translate demos
